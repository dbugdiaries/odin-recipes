  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular Indian appetizer featuring cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) marinated in a spiced yogurt blend and grilled until charred and smoky. It’s perfect for parties or as a starter to an Indian meal.</p>
  <p>The yogurt marinade infuses the paneer with vibrant flavors of cumin, coriander, and garam masala, while the char from the grill adds an irresistible depth.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>250 g paneer, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 onion, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>¾ cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tbsp oil (plus extra for brushing)</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk together yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, cumin, coriander, lemon juice, oil, and salt to make a smooth marinade.</li>
    <li>Add paneer cubes, bell pepper, and onion to the marinade. Gently toss to coat everything evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush with a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Thread marinated paneer, pepper, and onion alternately onto skewers.</li>
    <li>Place skewers on the grill. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, turning occasionally, until charred spots appear and vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, transfer to a serving platter, and sprinkle with chopped coriander.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with mint-coriander chutney and lemon wedges.</li>
  </ol>
