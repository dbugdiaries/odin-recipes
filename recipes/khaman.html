    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Khaman is a soft, spongy chickpea cake from Gujarat, and it&apos;s the kind of dish that surprises you with every bite. It&apos;s a great reminder of how Indian cuisine, even in its simplest forms, can be so intriguing and full of depth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Green chilies</li>
        <li>Gram flour (chickpea flour)</li>
        <li>Golden Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>
        <li>Green chilies</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Mustard seeds</li>
        <li>Curry leaves</li>
        <li>Golden Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Freshly grated coconut</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>If using, peel the ginger and trim the chillies and grind both to a paste in a pestle and mortar. You can also blend it with a little bit of the water we&apos;ll use later on.</li>
        <li>Sift the gram flour into a large bowl, then add the salt and sugar.</li>
        <li>Whisk to mix well. Pour in 230ml of water along with the lemon juice, oil and ginger-chilli paste and whisk it into a smooth batter. It should be thick but flowing. You can add more gram flour or water to adjust the texture.Cover and rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare your steamer. I usually use a wide casserole and place a heat-proof bowl in the center to act as a trivet. Add enough water (around 1l) to generously cover the bottom of the pan without reaching the top of the bowl. Bring to a boil. Brush a baking tin with a little bit of oil and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the baking soda to the batter and whisk gently for just 5 seconds to distribute it evenly. It should react immediately and turn the batter bubbly. Quickly pour the batter into the prepared tin.</li>
        <li>Steam the khaman covered for 25 minutes over medium heat. At this point, a knife should come out clean, otherwise steam it for a little longer.</li>
        <li>Remove the tin from the steamer and allow the khaman to cool whilst you prepare the tempering and toppings.</li>
        <li>If using fresh coconut, remove the flesh and grate some of it for the garnish. Trim and thinly slice the green chillies. Trim and discard the lower stems of the coriander and finely chop the rest. In a small pan, heat the oil and add the mustard seeds. As soon as they begin to sizzle vigorously, add the curry leaves and green chillies. Once the leaves begin to turn crispy, pour in the water, sugar and a pinch of salt and let it come to a boil. Give it a good stir and switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>Gently invert the Khaman onto a board. Cut it into squares, then transfer them to a plate, rearranging the pieces to keep the initial shape.</li>
        <li>Evenly pour the tempering over the pieces.</li>
        <li>Finally, garnish with the chopped coriander and grated coconut and serve, ideally alongside Coriander Chutney for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
